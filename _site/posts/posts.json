    "contents": "\r\nThis project was motivated based on the recent market reaction to the\r\nMini-Budget announcement by Kwasi Kwarteng, the Chancellor of the UK\r\nExchequer. This market reaction saw both the gilts markets and the\r\nGBP-USD fx market having a sharp volatility with the latter witnessing a\r\nrecord low of the British pound against the dollar.\r\nWhile I also believe the tax cuts to have been an ill-timed project,\r\nI was more interested in how sharp these markets reacted to that\r\nannouncement, and went ahead to conduct a granger causality test testing\r\nthe relationship between these two markets that stood out.\r\nThe image below shows the first model explaining the gilt 10 year\r\nbonds on the Gbp-Usd exchange price, indicating that at the 5% level of\r\nsignificance, we reject the null hypothesis of no relationship.\r\n The image below also shows\r\nthe second model explaining the gbp-usd exchange prices on the gilt\r\n10year bonds, indicating also that at the 5% level of significance, we\r\nreject the null hypothesis of no relationship.\r\n\r\nOverall, I conclude on a bidirectional causality relationship between\r\nthe two markets which present a potential forecasting feature. The full\r\ncodes and discussion are attached in my GitHub File which is accessible\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
