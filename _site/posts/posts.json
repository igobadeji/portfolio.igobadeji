    "contents": "\r\nBased on the market reaction to the fallout of the Ukraine-Russia war\r\nwhere countries had to battle with increasing oil prices, exchange\r\nrates, and overall, inflation, my interests led me to examine what\r\ncausal relationship may exist between macroeconomic variables and the\r\nperformance of the financial markets. Methodology was done with R and\r\ndata obtained from four countries, with equal representation (two\r\ncountries each) from both developed and emerging markets.\r\nDeveloped Countries were United Kingdom and the Japan, while emerging\r\nmarkets were Russia and India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
